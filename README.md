Project Title: Multi-Model Image Classification Using Transfer Learning with Attention Mechanism

Project Description:
This project implements an advanced image classification pipeline leveraging multiple pre-trained deep learning models (VGG16, VGG19, MobileNet, and Xception) combined with attention mechanisms to enhance feature extraction and classification accuracy. The pipeline is designed to classify medical images (or other datasets) into four distinct categories.

Key Features:
1.	Data Preprocessing and Augmentation:

•	Image paths and labels are dynamically generated and stored in a DataFrame.
•	Class imbalance is addressed using Random Oversampling.
•	Data is split into training, validation, and testing subsets with stratified sampling for balanced distributions.
•	Images are preprocessed with normalization (rescale=1./255) to optimize model performance.

2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

•	Distribution of categories visualized through count plots and pie charts.
•	Displays a grid of sample images from each category.

3.	Transfer Learning:

•	Integrates popular pre-trained models (VGG16, VGG19, MobileNet, Xception) as feature extractors.
•	Freezes pre-trained layers to retain pre-learned features while fine-tuning the classification layers.

4.	Attention Mechanism:

•	Adds a Multi-Head Attention layer to focus on significant features within the extracted feature maps.
•	Enhances interpretability and classification performance.

5.	Regularization Techniques:

•	Applies Gaussian Noise, Batch Normalization, and Dropout layers to reduce overfitting.

6.	Model Training and Evaluation:

•	Compiles models using Adam optimizer with a custom learning rate.
•	Tracks performance metrics (accuracy, loss) for training and validation sets.
•	Utilizes Early Stopping to prevent overfitting and ensure optimal weights.
•	Visualizes training/validation accuracy and loss through plots.


7.	Performance Metrics:

•	Generates classification reports with precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.
•	Constructs a confusion matrix heatmap to evaluate model predictions.


Applications:
•	Medical Image Classification (e.g., tumor identification, disease diagnosis).
•	Object detection and categorization tasks in any domain.
•	Use case development for Transfer Learning and Attention Mechanisms.

•	Python: Core programming language.
•	TensorFlow/Keras: Deep learning framework.
•	Seaborn & Matplotlib: Data visualization libraries.
•	Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and processing tools.
